# Integration Document - Dummy

## 1. External System Integrations

### 1.1. KeyLink Integration
The PKI management system will integrate with KeyLink for secure key management and cryptographic operations. This integration will involve:
- Secure communication protocols.
- API calls for key generation, signing, and encryption/decryption.
- Handling of KeyLink-specific error codes and responses.

### 1.2. HSM (Hardware Security Module) Integration
The system will utilize HSMs for the secure generation and storage of cryptographic keys, especially for Root CAs and Issuing CAs.
- PKCS#11 interface for HSM communication.
- Redundancy and failover mechanisms for HSMs.

### 1.3. External PKI Integration
The system may need to integrate with external PKI systems for cross-certification or certificate validation.
- Support for standard protocols like OCSP and CRL distribution.
- Handling of external CA certificates and trust anchors.

## 2. Internal System Integrations

### 2.1. Database Integration
- MariaDB for storing certificate metadata, user information, and audit logs.
- Database replication for high availability.

### 2.2. Monitoring System Integration
- Integration with internal monitoring tools for system health and performance metrics.
- Alerting mechanisms for critical events (e.g., certificate expiry, HSM failure).
